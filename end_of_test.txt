When user finished his fitness test we want to display a summary for him.

Now from POST /profile/tests/results we will get a response like this:

{
    "user_levels_id": "b8883514-0235-40c9-8f06-4e6a6bf45d34",
    "test_id": "8e92ce03-7d8a-4637-b066-553b693b3775",
    "levels": {
        "per_category": {
            "LOWER": "ADVANCED",
            "PUSH": "ADVANCED",
            "PULL": "ADVANCED",
            "CORE": "ADVANCED",
            "COND": "BEGINNER"
        },
        "global_level": "INTERMEDIATE",
        "global_level_raw_avg_points": 2.6
    }
}

We want to display to the user a summary like this (format it with best design practices):
