### Push-Ups

**Goal:**
Perform as many push-ups as you can with **good form**.

**How to do it:**

* Start in a plank position

* Keep your body in a straight line
* Lower your chest toward the floor, then push back up
* Choose the **hardest variation you can perform safely**

**Important:**

* If you can’t do a regular push-up, try **knee**, **incline**, or **wall** push-ups
* Quality matters more than the number of reps
* Stop if you feel pain in your shoulders or wrists
